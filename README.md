# Crowd Detection AI Model

This repository contains a **Crowd Detection AI Model** that utilizes deep learning and computer vision to detect and analyze crowd density in images and video streams. The model is designed to help monitor crowded areas for security, safety, and management purposes. It leverages **OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras, and YOLO (You Only Look Once)** for real-time object detection and crowd counting.

## Features
- **Real-Time Crowd Detection**: Identifies and counts people in video streams.
- **Deep Learning-Based Approach**: Utilizes pre-trained models like YOLO or Faster R-CNN.
- **Custom Dataset Training**: Fine-tuned on a dataset for improved accuracy.
- **Scalability**: Can be used for live surveillance, smart city applications, and event monitoring.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Crowd-Detection-AI.git
cd Crowd-Detection-AI
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the model on an image:
```bash
python detect_crowd.py --image path/to/image.jpg
```

To run the model on a live video feed:
```bash
python detect_crowd.py --video path/to/video.mp4
```

For real-time detection using a webcam:
```bash
python detect_crowd.py --webcam
```
